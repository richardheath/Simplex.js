# Simplex.js 0.0.3

Simplex.js is my attempt to simplify the development of JavaScript applications.
It is based on the ideas of Backbone.js, Marionette.js, and other libraries simplified to satisfy my
development style.

This project is still experimental. I am tweaking the API to simplify it based on my experience on
using it in real world application. Suggestions on how to improve the API is always welcome including
explanation on why the change is necessary.

My personal website is already using this Simplex.js:
